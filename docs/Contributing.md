# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.
As much as possible try to follow these simple rules:

- Separate PRs in logical commits, this makes it easier to bisect in case of bugs, and also helps with code review.
- Avoid long PRs, better to make multiple small ones.
- Open an issue before starting to work on big changes, so you can get feedbacks before doing too much work.

Read the [development document](./Development.md) for some help in getting started.
