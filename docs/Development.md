# Development

To develop the application, you need at least a nodejs environment.

In addition, ensure that protobuf compiler `protoc` is installed and added to the `PATH` environment variable before running `npm install`.

After running `npm install`, it will automatically generate an internal library `@internal/gen-grpc` from `gen-grpc` folder containing javascript protobuf files with types and `.proto` files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run electron-dev`

Starts up the webapp on `localhost:3000` and creates an Electron instance that is pointed at the webapp.

Run `npm install grpc --runtime=electron --target=7.0.0` prior to launching this command.

### `npm run electron-dev-simple`

Creates an Electron instance that is pointed at the webapp, so assumes that the dev server is already up.
Useful for running multiple instance of the application in development.

Run `npm install grpc --runtime=electron --target=7.0.0` prior to launching this command.

### `npm run dist`

Builds the app for Electron and creates a platform specific executable ( .exe on Windows, .dmg on MacOS, AppImage on Linux, the outputs can be further configured)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run mocha`

This will run some integration tests on a full electron instance. Since it is being run on electron and the current libraries are built for the local OS, you will need to rebuild them for electron, in specifically the `grpc` library.

`npm install grpc --runtime=electron --target=7.0.0`

## Integration Tests

The client integration tests requires multiple services to run:

- Rest Oracle [documentation](https://github.com/cryptogarageinc/p2pderivatives-oracle)
- Grpc Server [documentation](https://github.com/cryptogarageinc/p2pderivatives-server)
- BitcoinD instance running on `regtest`

You can run all of those services on your local machine using `docker-compose up`

The services will need some migration to run the integration tests.
You can seed the services for integration tests using `./services/seed-services.sh`
or by service using a specific script  
`docker-compose exec <service-name> /bin/sh /scripts/<my-script-name>`

You can then run all the integration tests using `npm run integration`
